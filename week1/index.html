    <p>
       <em>Cyanotype printmaking</em> is a monochromatic printmaking method that utilizes the chemicals ferric ammonium citrate and potassium ferricyanide. </p>
        Potassium ferricyanide has a bright red coloration.
    </p>
        The granules have a magical shimmering quality. Ferric ammonium citrate contrasts greatly it is a powdery chartreuse.
        

    <p>
        The chemical mixture creates a light-sensitive surface and when exposed to the sun with an object or photographic negative it creates a photogram.
